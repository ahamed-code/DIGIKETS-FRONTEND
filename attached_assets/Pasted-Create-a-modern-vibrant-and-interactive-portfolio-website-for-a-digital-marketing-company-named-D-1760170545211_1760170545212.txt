Create a modern, vibrant, and interactive portfolio website for a digital marketing company named “Digikets Marketing”, founded by a creative digital marketer. 🌐 1. Intro Page / Landing Animation When the visitor enters the site, display a multi-language welcome animation that shows “Welcome”, “Vanakkam”, “Namaste”, “Swagatam”, “Suswagatam”, “Nomoshkar”, “Salaam”, etc. (in different Indian languages) — one by one with smooth transitions. After that, reveal the text “Welcome to Digikets Marketing” in a colorful gradient typography with subtle particle and smoke effects. Follow this by showing the owner’s picture with an animated flip coin effect — on one side the owner’s face, and when the user hovers or moves the cursor, it rotates to reveal the company logo on the other side. 🏠 2. Home Section Show a clean section introducing Digikets Marketing — highlight it as a result-driven digital marketing company helping brands grow online. Add short content from the owner’s documentation (profile, expertise, and message). Include subtle background animations — like a colorful smoky cursor trail, floating icons of YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook. Use a scroll-to-top button that appears smoothly when scrolling down. 💼 3. Projects Section Display client projects with creative animated cards: NM Metal Roofing — YouTube channel with 1K+ subscribers. Sri Thirumalai Roofings — Instagram & Facebook presence with 1K+ followers. SN Metal — Raw material supplier (project in initial stages). Manju’s Magic — Bridal & beauty-related makeup brand. KHS Sterile Solutions — New YouTube project, currently being managed and grown by Digikets. Each project card should have: Company logo or image Platform icons (YouTube / Instagram / Facebook) Short project description and metrics (followers/subscribers) Hover animation with smooth zoom or glow effect 🏢 4. Company Info Section Include a section that tells the story of Digikets Marketing, the vision and mission, and how it helps clients grow through digital storytelling, video marketing, and social media optimization. Display some fun stats — number of clients, campaigns run, total views generated, etc., using animated counters. 📞 5. Contact Section Include a Contact Form (connected with SMTP for sending emails directly from the portfolio). Add WhatsApp integration (click to open chat) and email link (mailto). Design a default email template for messages received from the website, formatted with: Subject: “New Message from Digikets Portfolio Website” Body: Name, Email, Message content, and Timestamp. 💡 6. UI & Design Features Use smooth scroll animations (Framer Motion or GSAP-like) for transitions. Include smoky colorful cursor trails that change color dynamically as the user moves. Bright, digital-themed color palette (purple, cyan, pink, and orange gradients). Use responsive design (desktop, tablet, and mobile friendly). Navigation bar with sections: Home, Projects, Company Info, Contact. Sticky navbar with active link highlight while scrolling. Add subtle background music or sound cue (optional, toggled by user). ⚙️ 7.
